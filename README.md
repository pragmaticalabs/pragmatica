# Pragmatica Aether

Pragmatica Aether is a clusterized run-time environment for Java.

## Purpose 

Pragmatica Aether targets two main use cases:
- Transformation of the traditional monolithic applications into distributed ones with all relevant benefits like scalability and fault tolerance. The intent is to provide environment which is as close to monolith as possible, including transparence of the distributed invocations and similar to traditional transaction handling.
- Run-time environment for highly scalable distributed applications which have no limitations nor drawbacks of the legacy microservices approach. It reduces infrastructure complexity and complicated deployment burden, enabling transparent (and simultaneous, if necessary) deployment across different public clouds, private clouds and data centers.
