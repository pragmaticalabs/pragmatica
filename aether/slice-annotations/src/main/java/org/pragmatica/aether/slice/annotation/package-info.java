/// Compile-time annotations for Aether slice development.
///
/// This package provides annotations used by the slice annotation processor
/// to generate type-safe APIs, proxies, and factories for inter-slice communication.
///
/// **Key annotations:**
///
///   - {@link org.pragmatica.aether.slice.annotation.Slice} - Marks an interface as a slice implementation
///
///
/// This module has zero runtime dependencies, allowing slices to be developed
/// without depending on the Aether node runtime.
